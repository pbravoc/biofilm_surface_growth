# 3 replicates (A:C) grown for 48 hours (001:234). HUGE lateral growth.
# 3 controls measured after 48h
# Sample A At around t=35h, there's a big jump, is it because the stitching is pushing down (<) or pushing up(>)?
# Sample B
# Sample C At around t=29h, there's a big jump, is it because the stitching is pushing down (<) or pushing up(>)?
